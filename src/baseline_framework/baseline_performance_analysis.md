## Detailed Performance Analysis

### Response Time Characteristics

The system shows excellent and consistent performance across all query types:

- **Average Response Time:** 165.9ms (well within acceptable limits)
- **Median Response Time:** 165.3ms (consistent with average, showing good distribution)
- **95th Percentile:** 235.3ms (even complex queries complete quickly)
- **Range:** 51.2ms - 248.5ms (narrow range indicates predictable performance)

**Performance by Complexity:**
- **Simple queries** (postcodes, cities): ~150-170ms
- **Complex queries** (multi-field): ~175-250ms
- **Edge cases**: ~146ms (often filtered out quickly)

### Accuracy Deep Dive

The accuracy results reveal important insights about the current matching approach:

#### By Query Category:
1. **Edge Cases: 62.5%** - Surprisingly high due to correctly identifying invalid queries
2. **Postcode-Only: 40.0%** - Good performance on structured data
3. **Abbreviations: 16.7%** - Moderate performance with abbreviation expansion
4. **Partial/City-Only: 16.7%** - Challenge with incomplete information
5. **Exact Matches: 14.3%** - Lower than expected, indicating room for improvement
6. **Complex Queries: 0.0%** - Significant challenge area
7. **Typos: 0.0%** - Primary improvement opportunity

#### Analysis of Low Accuracy:

The 22.4% overall top-1 accuracy, while initially concerning, reflects several factors:

1. **Strict Matching Criteria:** Our evaluation requires 70% of expected fields to match exactly
2. **Multiple Valid Results:** Portuguese cities have many streets with similar names
3. **Data Completeness:** Some expected results may not exist in our 651K record dataset
4. **Normalization Effects:** Address normalization may alter expected matching patterns

## Category-Specific Performance Insights

### üèÜ Best Performing Categories

#### 1. Edge Cases (62.5% accuracy, 146ms avg)
- **Strength:** Correctly identifies and rejects invalid queries
- **Examples:** Empty strings, foreign cities, nonsensical queries
- **Insight:** System properly handles error conditions

#### 2. Postcode-Only Queries (40.0% accuracy, 165ms avg)
- **Strength:** Structured data matching works well
- **Examples:** "1000-001" (Lisboa), "4000-001" (Porto)
- **Insight:** Exact matching on formatted data is reliable

#### 3. Abbreviation Queries (16.7% accuracy, 162ms avg)
- **Strength:** Successfully expands "r." ‚Üí "rua", "av." ‚Üí "avenida"
- **Challenge:** May match correct street but in different city
- **Example Success:** "r augusta lisboa" correctly found

### üìâ Challenging Categories

#### 1. Typo Queries (0.0% accuracy, 163ms avg)
- **Challenge:** Current fuzzy matching insufficient for Portuguese addresses
- **Examples:** "rua agusta" ‚Üí "rua augusta", "liberdad" ‚Üí "liberdade"
- **Opportunity:** Improve fuzzy matching parameters and algorithms

#### 2. Complex Multi-Field Queries (0.0% accuracy, 176ms avg)
- **Challenge:** Multiple components create conflicting signals
- **Examples:** "rua augusta 100 lisboa" includes house number
- **Opportunity:** Better field parsing and weighting

#### 3. Exact Matches (14.3% accuracy, 187ms avg)
- **Surprising Result:** Should perform better than abbreviations
- **Analysis:** Likely due to city variations or street name alternatives
- **Example:** "praca do comercio lisboa" may match but not be recognized
