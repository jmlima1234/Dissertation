=========================================================
Generated: 2025-09-22 14:39:56
Dataset: Portuguese Address Database (enderecos_normalizados)

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
------------------
Index Types Tested: 4 (None, GiST, SP-GiST, BRIN)
Spatial Queries: 7 diverse spatial operations
Total Measurements: 28
Methodology: Controlled comparison with statistical significance testing

INDEX BUILD PERFORMANCE
----------------------
    GIST: 1.4s build time, 28.6MB storage
  SPGIST: 1.9s build time, 33.3MB storage
    BRIN: 0.1s build time, 0.0MB storage

QUERY PERFORMANCE RESULTS
-------------------------
    GIST: 131.60x avg speedup, 3/7 significant improvements
  SPGIST: 1.29x avg speedup, 2/7 significant improvements
    BRIN: 1.00x avg speedup, 1/7 significant improvements

KEY FINDINGS FOR DISSERTATION
-----------------------------
• Best overall performance: GIST
• Most consistent results: BRIN 
• Fastest to build: BRIN
• Most storage efficient: BRIN

ACADEMIC CONTRIBUTIONS
---------------------
1. First comprehensive spatial index comparison for Portuguese address data
